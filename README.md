## Overview

HanGang-Mate is a Flutter-based mobile app that predicts parking lot congestion in Yeouido and Ttukseom Hangang Parks using machine learning.  
The app provides real-time parking information and future congestion predictions based on holidays, time slots, and parking lot locations.  
It also offers navigation assistance to help users find parking spots in real time.

- **Team Size:** 5 members  
- **Project Duration:** November 1, 2024 â€“ November 22, 2024

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/shinjs99/HanGang-Mate.git`
2. Install Flutter dependencies  
   `flutter pub get`
3. Run the app  
   `flutter run`
4. Backend setup (for ML prediction API):
   - The backend (FastAPI) source code is in the `/Python/Server` directory.
   - To run the backend:
     1. Open a terminal and go to the `Python/Server` folder.
     2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
        `python3 -m venv venv`
        `source venv/bin/activate`
     3. Install dependencies:
        `pip install -r ../requirements.txt`
     4. Start the FastAPI server:
        `uvicorn parking:app --reload`
   - The Flutter app uses Firebase directly; there is **no separate Firebase folder**.  
     Make sure your Firebase project is set up and configured in your Flutter app as described in the Flutter/Firebase documentation.
